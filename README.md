# Data Science for Public Policy - Final Project
## Hannah Reynolds, Maleeha Hameed, and Ritwika Rituparna

This project aims at exploring the impact of household characteristics and schooling history on individual students' learning outcomes in basic numeracy and literacy, using machine learning tools. 

We have used two datasets from the Learning and Educational Achievements in Pakistan Schools (LEAPS) public database: 
1) data from the last round of data collection at the school level across three districts in 2011
2) master student IRT (item response theory) test score dataset
Additionally, we have used geospatial data containing Pakistan’s geographical boundaries at three levels – national, provincial, and district. We sourced this data from the (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.) database and merged it with district-level boundaries from another website called [CARTO](https://carto.com/dataset/pakistan_districts). Moreover, we also used LEAPS data containing GPS coordinates of sampled schools in the three districts.

The project includes exploratory data analysis for test scores in English, Urdu, and Maths, followed by predictive modelling using linear regression, decision tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors methods for test scores in each of the three subjects.
